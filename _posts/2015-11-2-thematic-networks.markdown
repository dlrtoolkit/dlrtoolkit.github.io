*Thematic Networks* is a great step-by-step tool dedicated for analyzing and synthesizing qualitative data. It collects textual data and organizes the information into a network diagram. 

Thematic networks has three classes of themes:


  * *Basic Themes* are simple premises of the collected data that say very little on their own. As they are clustered together they start complimenting each other and form organizing themes.
  * *Organizing Themes* assemble basic themes into similar clusters forming an argument or position about the situation.
  * *Global Themes* filter organizing themes into one insight that summarizes the comprehensive issue.

Thematic Networks breaks down the textual data into manageable clusters of patterns and themes. It explores the relationships between an idea or a matter from a micro to a macro perspective.

**Advantages**: explores multiple relationships between the understanding of an issue; analyses complex data; lets categories emerge from data.

**Disadvantages**: strongly depends on data collected in other methods; the global theme may rule out nuanced data; clustering the info depends on the researcherâ€™s interpretation.

## Tips

  * Thematic Networks requires textual data in order to be applied as a method. Thus, prior to using it, one needs to collect data from other methods such as interviews, storytelling, diary studies.
  * Using post-it notes is very useful in this exercise because it allows you to move the basic themes till you settle for the clustering that you think is best.
