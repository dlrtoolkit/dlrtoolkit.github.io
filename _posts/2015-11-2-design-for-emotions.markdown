*Design for Emotions* is an approach that enables you to take the intended emotional impact as the leading principle in the design process. The approach can be used to define an appropriate emotional effect, and gather relevant user information so that this emotional effect can be achieved.

**Advantages**: predefined emotional intentions; envision concepts that evoke the intended effect; measure to what extent the design concept evokes intended emotion.

**Disadvantages**: does not take other relevant aspects and/or requirements into consideration; requires experience over concepts.
