**Analogies & Metaphors** are strategies for interviewing, observation, and evaluation that invite new questions and observations by comparison. In early stages of the design process, drawing analogies and metaphors to wildly different systems can illuminate unexpected similarities or remind researchers of previously forgotten or assumed parts of a process. This tactic may continue during evaluation phases of design, but at this point A&M can also become a form of research representation. Drawing connections between an observed system and a metaphor becomes a more meaningful way to explain purpose, to suggest the rules people follow, or the elements that are central and peripheral.

**Advantages**: can be applied to many situations; playful, symbolic; can be used to talk about oneself through a symbol; systems-focused, invites people to make connections.

**Disadvantages**: may lose some meaning in cultural/individual translation; can be complicated to set-up because it requires entering imaginative space.
