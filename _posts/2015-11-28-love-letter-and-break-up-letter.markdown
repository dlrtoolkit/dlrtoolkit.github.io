**Love Letter and Break Up Letter** is *coming soon*.

**Advantages**: by humanizing the object/experience people reveal things they otherwise would not.

**Disadvantages**: can be somewhat rigid; best if the people polled are creative, can be difficult with less imaginative people.

## Case Studies/Examples  

[Smart Design: The Break-Up Letter](https://vimeo.com/11854531)  
Here is great video from Smart Design showing how effective the break-up letter can be. It shows how people have the most fun when they are being very specific which is great for exploring how something can be better. 

[Smart Design: Love Letters](https://vimeo.com/14813183)  
Another great video from Smart Design. It shows how people will really highlight strongly the things they love about an object. Who knew mundane specifics could be so emotionally charged! Consider that these are all women. Do men have a tougher time writing a love letter? 

[6 Designers Break-Up With Once-Cherished Products](www.fastcodesign.com/3025448/6-designers-break-up-with-once-cherished-products#2)  
Another great example of breakup letters. Notice though how creative these are. This could be because they are done by designers who have considered the very specific grievances they have. The average person may not be as fruitful.

## Tips
This method is all about exploring the relationship you have with something as if it was a human relationship so you do not need to stop at just love/break-up letters. To expand what is possible with this message one can ask other questions revolving around being in a relationship with the object/experience. What would you get it on you anniversary? How would you introduce it to your friends and/or family? 

Also, keep in mind when and where you are asking them to write the letters. If they are breaking up with the subway system you will have different letters if you ask them while they are riding the subway versus reflecting on riding the subway.

Also consider how specific you want the person to be. Are they breaking up with the subway car? The subway system? The people on it? The experience? Consider if you want to guide them to explore a specific part or if you would just like to see what is most emotional and relevant for them.
